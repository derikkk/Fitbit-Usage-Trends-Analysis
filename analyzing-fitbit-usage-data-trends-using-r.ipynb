Their aim is to create fashionable, fitness smart products that integrate seamlessly into womens' lifestyles. Currently their products collect data on sleep, stress, activity, and reproductive health. This analysis is tailored towards marketing Bellabeat's wearable smart device 'Leaf' and its accompanying app. \n\n#### Analysis Objectives:\n\n1. Finding Patterns\n    + What features encourage users to frequently/consistently use their smart device?\n    + Based on these features, which customer segments should Bellabeat's marketing team target?\n2. Discover Connections\n    + How does daily steps, sleep, activity, intensity, and calories burned correlate to one another?\n3. Make Educated Predictions \n    + How can Bellabeat use information about key features and correlated factors to inform their marketing strategy?\n    \n#### Accessing and Sourcing Reliable Data \nI used [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) under the CC0: Public Domain license (dataset made available by [Möbius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic) ).

Based on Bellabeat's website they are targeting women who are: active, young, and fashionable. My main takeaway is how can Bellabeat make the Leaf more inclusive and specific to a broader range of lifestyles. To appeal to a wider audience, Bellabeat should help inactive/unhealthy individuals work towards a healthy lifestyle. Below I outlined a few recommendations to help Bellabeat refine their branding.  \n\n\n#### **How can I apply my findings to Bellabeat's marketing efforts?**\n1. Play an active/proactive role in consumer health  \n>Use reminders to spend more time in bed based on sleep duration and quality. Highlight the broader application of health metrics relevant to pandemic times. Promote material on how the Leaf can help track sleep quality (and other metrics) to determine health. Provide an overview of incremental improvements to work towards (or maintain) a healthy lifestyle. \n\n2. Apply a data-driven approach to optimizing health \n>Place more focus on user data analytics and continual feedback. Continuous interactions can help increase engagement between users with different activity levels. Bellabeat could promote this approach through social media channels and blogs. Lastly, educate users about the importance of lesser known metrics (like sleep efficiency) through blogs, short reels (IG reels, Tiktok), and short informative notifications. \n\n3. \"Gameify\" Bellabeat's smart app\n>As a smart fitness device user, I was surprised by the inconsistency of these datasets. I rarely miss tracking my day because of the social element- comparing my daily statistics with my friends. Fitbit's initial success relied on adding social and competitive elements to their app UI. Bellabeat could also analyze user data to create comparative statistics customised to each user. I also really like [Whoop's use of communities](https://support.whoop.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043767753-Joining-a-Public-WHOOP-Team) to motivate users with similar interests.  \n\n\n#### **Additional data to expand on findings**\n  * Larger data set (more individuals across a longer period of time) to increase statistical power and bring more reliability/credibility to analysis\n  * Detailed demographic data for FitBit users to account for for cultural, geographical, and socio-economic factors \n  * Existing data by Bellabeat on 'reproductive health' statistics that they track. This could reveal how activity, sleep, and reproductive health are related and how Bellabeat can guide their female users.  \n  \n    \n##### If you're here congrats! You've stuck with me throughout this brain-racking but ultra-rewarding process. I'm still a beginner in my data analystics journey so any comments/feedback would be much appreciated!  \n\n##### Some newbie issues I ran into: \n  * When transferring code from R into Kaggle I encountered some errors that weren't an issue in R. However in Kaggle it prevented me from properly executing sections of my code. Specifically, I had trouble with merging my dataframes by \"Id\" and struggled with why I couldn't group.by then summarize (even though it had worked in R). I would really appreciate it if anyone knows why this happened and can share with me! ","metadata":{}}]}
